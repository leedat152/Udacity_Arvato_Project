## Project Overview
In this project, we are provided with demographic data of customers of a mail-order company in Germany and demographic data of general population of Germany. Using this data, we are required to identify new customers for the company
The project has three major steps: the customer segmentation report, the supervised learning model, and the Kaggle Competition.

1. Customer Segmentation Report
I'll begin the project by using unsupervised learning methods to analyze attributes of established customers and the general population in order to create customer segments.

2. Supervised Learning Model
I'll have access to a third dataset with attributes from targets of a mail order campaign. I'll use the previous analysis to build a machine learning model that predicts whether or not each individual will respond to the campaign.

3. Kaggle Competition
In this section. I'll rank the individuals by how likely they are to convert to being a customer, and see how your modeling skills measure up against your fellow students.

## Technical Overview
Step by step workflow from gathering , assessing , cleaning data, exploring data analysis to building model. These following steps are described in detail in notebook:
- Gathering data
- Assessing data
- Explore data analysis
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Clustering using KMeans
- Supervised learning
- Tuning model 
- Kaggle competition

## Installation 
Besides the libraries included in Anaconda distribution for Python 3.6, I have used other libraries to support for this project:
- `XGBosst` - an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable
